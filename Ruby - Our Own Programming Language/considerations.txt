Considerations:
- Should you be able to call function on non-variables
- Variables in Ruby are not automatically being copied which we want to do.
- Should input/output have semantic meaning in the programming language or should they be built-in functions.
- Should we require semicolon after "restart" in start_statement?
- Should we really have multiple logical operators connected to same value?
- Should we separate <data> and <name> since sometimes you should only need data and sometimes only name? Also, should we directly use IDENTIFIER instead of data?
- Should setter be public accessor instead

Considerations:
- Should you be able to multiply strings and chars?

- Do we want to be able to declare variable with same name if inside deeper scope
x = 0;
fun test()
{
    x = 10;
}
