- Idea:
• Lines on papers
• Jump between papers/obstacles, by releasing finger
• Chased by an eraser, player is a stick figure, falling down/erased from line if not too quick

- Game modes:
• Tutorial, diving directly into the game theme and fast spaced gameplay
• Drag, speed varies based on player drag speed (loops possible)
• Constant speed, player holds to follow (loops only possible if pausing, 
which can disturb the game flow).
