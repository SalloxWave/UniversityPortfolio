# Android game Speed Eraser
## Fast paced game with a colorful feeling

## Gameplay
The goal of this game is basically to erase lines on paper with both precision and speed. The screen will follow a line and the player will try to erase as much as possible of the line before reaching the end of the line. You can't just erase furiously since the eraser will be consumed and decrease in size as you erase. This makes a good challenge since you you need to be quick and precise at the same time. When the level is finished (reaching end of the line), you will gain feedback of how well you did.

### Another challenging factors (added in later versions, lower priority)
• There will be different obstacles giving penalties when touched. <br />
• Sometimes the line can change in size which requires player to zoom out or in to be able to continue. <br />
• Some levels requires two fingers erasing two separate lines, which also can cross. <br />
• "Extra" lines and figures on the side of the level which only gives extra points


## Controls
• Hold and drag to erase <br />
• Release finger to stop erase <br />
• Pinch to zoom in or out


## Custom level editor (added in later versions, lower priority)
The game is built in a way which makes it easy for players to create own levels. You can easily "paint" a line of a level and drag obstacles onto a level. A player can then publish a level and let others play it and compete for the best score. This creates a community driven game where only the player's creativity is the limit.


## In-game shop
Everything bought in game is paid by some kind of in-game credit which can be earned while playing or buying for real money (undecided what kind of credit)
### Possible usage of credits
• Skins for erasers <br />
• Temporary eraser enlargement to make level easier (1 use only and not usable on custom maps) <br />
• Colors and backgrounds for papers (level editor) <br />
• Colors and skins for lines (level editor) <br />
• Different kinds of obstacles (level editor)
