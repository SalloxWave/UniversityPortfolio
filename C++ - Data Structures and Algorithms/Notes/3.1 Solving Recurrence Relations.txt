• Recurrence relations = model copst of recursive functions

- 3 Approaches solving reccurce relations:
• Estimation technique:
Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove. Tighten proof if required

• Summation: Expand reccurence to a summation and use summation techniques.

• Using already proven theorems of recurrence.
