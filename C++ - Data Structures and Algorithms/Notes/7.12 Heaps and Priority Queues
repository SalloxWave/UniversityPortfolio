Symbol: ϴ

Max heap: 
- All nodes stores a value greater than or equal to all its children
- Root stores maximum of all values in tree

Min heap: 
- All nodes stores a value less than or equal to all its children
- Root stores minimum of all values in tree

A heap is a natural implementation for the priority queue:
• Jobs can efficiently be ordered according their priority value
• An insert takes only ϴ(log n) time in the worse case. This is because the value being inserted at most will be moves from the bottom to the top.
• The cost to "build heap" is ϴ(n). Building kinda means converting an uncorrect heap into a correct min/max heap.
• Since the tree is log n levels deep, the cost for removing an element is ϴ(log n) in the average and worst case. To remove a node, you switch the node to remove with the last index, delete the last index and move previously swapped node in the tree accordingly.
