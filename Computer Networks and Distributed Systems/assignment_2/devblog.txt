commandline arguments for port-number now integrated.
ruby automagically includes all arguments into an array called ARGV.

proxy_client.read Probably waits for the connection to close before continuing.
this is backed up by the FAST WEBSITE having connection:close by default and the SLOW WEBSITE being unspecified.

    This website checks for cookies and javascript compability and redirects us to a weird path: "/cdn-cgi/l/chk_jschl?jschl_vc=4eec7b9a6f854050a1f90dc387038478&pass=1486728076.886-U2NPZZX0na&jschl_answer=-9931". This doesn't work for our proxy server.
