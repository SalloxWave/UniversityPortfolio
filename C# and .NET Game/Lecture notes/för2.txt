Composition: Doesn't have any meaning on its own

Dependency Injection (DI):

Same car with different engines
engine has interface
electronics of the car has interface

DI: If you want to have a car, ask for the engine and say what you attributes you want.
//Not DI
public Human()
{
	rHand = new Hand();
	lHand = new Hand();
}
//is DI
public Human(rHand, lHand)
{
	this.rHand =rHand;
	this.lHand = lHand
}
